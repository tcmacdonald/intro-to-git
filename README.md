Ever make changes that broke your code and forgot how your code worked before? Want to work with someone on a code project, but aren’t sure who has the latest version of a particular file? Version control can solve these problems and more! 

Git is a popular version control application that can track your code changes, as well as help you to be more methodical in your programming. Win win! This session will introduce the basics of version control, how to use git to keep track of your changes to a project, and using [GitHub](http://github.com) to collaborate with other developers.
